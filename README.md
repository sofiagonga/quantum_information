## Problem outline
I numerically study the behavior of integrable quantum systems and systems
exhibiting scrambling. 
An integrable system is one with extensively many (local) conserved quantities. Our prototypical example
is the transverse-field Ising model. By performing a Jordan-Wigner transformation, we can map this Hamiltonian to non-interacting fermions,
which we can then diagonalize by finding all single-particle eigenstates.
